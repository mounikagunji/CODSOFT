## 🌟 Overview  
The Number Guessing Game is a simple yet engaging console-based game. A random number is generated, and the player attempts to guess it. The game provides feedback ("Too High", "Too Low") and tracks scores. It’s an excellent project to showcase Java fundamentals, such as loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.
